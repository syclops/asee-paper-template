# ASEE Paper Template

A LaTeX paper template that can be used for the ASEE Annual Conference.

While I do my best to keep this template updated, you should always read the
Author's Kit document for the appropriate year's ASEE conference ([2025
example](https://www.asee.org/events/Conferences-and-Meetings/2025-Annual-Conference/Paper-Management/2025-Authors)).
